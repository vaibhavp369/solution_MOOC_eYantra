 *
 * @author     e-Yantra Team and VAIBHAV PATIL
 * @date       2020/02/12
 *
 * \subsection Aim
 * To toggle the status of 2 Bar-graph LEDs depending on whether the Interrupt Switch is pressed or released.
 *
 * \subsection Connections
 * Interrupt Switch				:  PE7 				<br>
 * Bar-graph LED 2				:  PJ1 				<br>
 * Bar-graph LED 6				:  PJ5 				<br>
 * Bar-graph LED 8				:  PJ7 				<br>

				Why did we include this delay?
				
				The reason is that mechanical switches like the Interrupt Switch have a limitation called switch bounce.
				You can read more about it here: http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/electronics/debounce.html , https://electrosome.com/switch-debouncing/
				The bar_graph_led_2_on and bar_graph_led_2_off functions execute in a few microseconds, but the switch itself needs time to settle after a press.
				Typically this time is in the order of a few milliseconds.
				Introducing a delay is the simplest way of mitigating for switch bounce and this process is called de-bouncing.
